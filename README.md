Derivative free 1D function minimizer in modern Fortran

![Build Status](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/fmin/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)

### Compiling

* A [Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) file is also included, so that the library and tests cases can be compiled with FPM. For example:

```
fpm build --profile release
fpm test --profile release
```

### Documentation

 * The API documentation for the current ```master``` branch can be found [here](https://jacobwilliams.github.io/fmin/).  This is generated by processing the source files with [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford).

### License

 * The Fmin source code and related files and documentation are distributed under a permissive free software [license](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/fmin/blob/master/LICENSE) (BSD-3).
